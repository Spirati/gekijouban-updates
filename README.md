# *Revue Starlight: The Movie* Showings Update Checker

i need to see this movie so bad but if i try to check the website myself every day i'll go insane
just set this up as a cron job to run daily and it'll post to a telegram channel of your choice (set the token + bot id in `.env`)

## .env template
```
GKJB_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=telegram bot token
GKJB_CHAT_ID=telegram chat id
```
